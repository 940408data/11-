# 古希腊

我希望尽我可能多地讲述，天才和劳动对人类文化遗产的贡献–记录和思考，它们的原因、性质和影响，发明的进步，经济组织的范围，政府的实验， 宗教的愿望，道德和礼仪的突变，文学的杰作，科学的发展，哲学的智慧，和艺术的成就。 我不需要被告知这个事业是多么荒谬，也不需要被告知它的概念是多么不谦虚 … 然而，我曾梦想，尽管在这项事业中不可避免有许多错误，但对于那些由于对哲学的热情，已经被强迫从整体上看待事物，对于通过时间中的历史，来追求视角、统一和理解，以及通过空间科学来寻求它们的人来说，它可能有些用处。与哲学一样，这样的冒险（如这11卷的创作）没有合理的借口，充其量只是勇敢的愚蠢；但让我们希望，像哲学一样，它将永远吸引一些鲁莽的灵魂，进入其致命的深度。

I discovered Will Durant many, many years ago when I was about 20...Now 41 years later at 61 his incredible scholarship combined with his superlative skills as a writer make resding him as fresh as it was more than four decades ago
Thank heavens for Will Durant.

I'm setting out on a monumental task: I've now aquired all 11 books in [S.of](http://s.of/) C. and am determined to read all straight through. At one time or another I've read some of the books, however very intermittently, very incompletely....But by Jove I'm gone do it....if it takes years!!!! Well being a young, or at least youthful feeling 61 years of age I gots something to keep me alive

Y'all wish me luck!!!!!!

就像你读过的任何其他作品一样，充满了奇迹和引用的散文。

As full of wonder and quotable prose as any other work you will ever read.

是的，这些书有相当一部分是厌女症、种族主义、恐同症和反共宣传，就像人们可以从它的发展趋势中预期的那样。

Yes, the books have a fair share of misogyny and racism, homophobia and anti-communist propagandizing as one might expect from anything published during it's tenor.

但是，原谅这些缺点，这项工作……

But, forgiving those shortcomings, the work...

这项工作是惊人的。

the work is amazing.

当我在2018年3月第一次开始阅读这个系列的时候，我的目的是保存一个引用的小本子。

When I first started reading the series in March of 2018, it was my intent to keep a little book of quotes.

我没读到第一本书的一半，就意识到书中引用的内容太多了。

I didn't make it halfway through the first book before I realized that there was simply too much that was quotable.

当我在2019年2月完成第11本书时，我感觉我的整个生活(和语言)都以一种深刻而有意义的方式升级了。

By the time I finished book 11 in February of 2019, I felt like my whole entire life (and language) had been upgraded in a deep and meaningful way.

这篇文章以一个伟大的诗人或政治家的口才完成，看，在成千上万的引用中，只有两句:“文明的存在是出于地质的同意，不需通知就会发生变化。”

The writing is done with the eloquence of a great bard or statesman-behold, just two quotes among thousands:"Civilization exists by geological consent, subject to change without notice."

“历史的教训之一是，不做往往是好事，说出来总是聪明的。”

"One of the lessons of history is that nothing is often a good thing to do and always a clever thing to say."

如果你是这样的人，看到这第二句话，不仅能感受到它所表达的内容的分量，还能感受到它写作方式的美感，那么你会爱上这些书。

If you are the kind of person who looks at that second quote and feels not only the weight of what it says, but the beauty in the way it is written, then you are going to love these books.

如果这句话对你有意义，那么你就会开始喜欢上第一页的这些书，而且永远不会停止热爱它们。

If that sentence speaks to you, then you are going to start loving these volumes on page one, and you will never stop loving them.

我完成《拿破仑时代》才几个星期，我就用饥饿的眼神看着《我们的东方遗产》。

It has only been a few weeks since I finished "The Age of Napoleon" and I am looking at "Our Oriental Heritage" with hungry eyes.

如果你的大脑能承受，没有什么比读这些书对你自己更有利的了。

If your brain is up to it, there is no greater favor you can do for yourself than to read these books.

我的目的是记录和思考希腊文明的起源、发展、成熟和衰落，从克里特岛和特洛伊最古老的遗迹到罗马征服希腊。


MY purpose is to record and contemplate the origin, growth, maturity, and decline of Greek civilization from the oldest remains of Crete and Troy to the conquest of Greece by Rome.

我希望看到和感受这种复杂的文化，不仅是它微妙而客观的兴衰节奏，而且是它丰富多样的重要元素:它从土地中获取生计的方式，它组织工业和贸易的方式;


I wish to see and feel this complex culture not only in the subtle and impersonal rhythm of its rise and fall, but in the rich variety of its vital elements: its ways of drawing a living from the land, and of organizing industry and trade;

它对君主制、贵族制、民主、独裁和革命进行了试验;


its experiments with monarchy, aristocracy, democracy, dictatorship, and revolution;

它的礼仪和道德，它的宗教实践和信仰;


its manners and morals, its religious practices and beliefs;

对儿童的教育，对性别和家庭的管理;


its education of children, and its regulation of the sexes and the family;

它的住宅、寺庙、市场、剧院和运动场;


its homes and temples, markets and theaters and athletic fields;

诗歌、戏剧、绘画、雕塑、建筑和音乐;


its poetry and drama, its painting, sculpture, architecture, and music;

它的科学和发明，它的迷信和哲学。


its sciences and inventions, its superstitions and philosophies.

我希望看到和感受到的不是这些元素在理论和学术上的孤立，而是它们在生活中的相互作用，就像一个伟大的文化有机体，有一百个器官和一亿个细胞，但有一个身体和一个灵魂同时运动。


I wish to see and feel these elements not in their theoretical and scholastic isolation, but in their living interplay as the simultaneous movements of one great cultural organism, with a hundred organs and a hundred million cells, but with one body and one soul.

------
除了机器，我们的文化中几乎没有任何非世俗的东西不是来自希腊。


Excepting machinery, there is hardly anything secular in our culture that does not come from Greece.

学校、体育馆、算术、几何、历史、修辞学、物理、生物、解剖学、卫生、治疗、化妆品、诗歌、音乐、悲剧、喜剧、哲学、神学、不可知论、怀疑主义、禁欲主义、享乐主义、伦理、政治、理想主义、慈善主义、专制、财阀政治、民主:这些都是希腊词汇，它们代表的文化形式很少起源，但在许多情况下，它们首先成熟为善或恶，是由希腊人的丰富能量产生的。


Schools, gymnasiums, arithmetic, geometry, history, rhetoric, physics, biology, anatomy, hygiene, therapy, cosmetics, poetry, music, tragedy, comedy, philosophy, theology, agnosticism, skepticism, stoicism, epicureanism, ethics, politics, idealism, philanthropy, cynicism, tyranny, plutocracy, democracy: these are all Greek words for cultural forms seldom originated, but in many cases first matured for good or evil by the abounding energy of the Greeks.

今天困扰我们的所有问题——森林砍伐和土壤侵蚀;


All the problems that disturb us today-the cutting down of forests and the erosion of the soil;

妇女的解放与家庭的限制


the emancipation of woman and the limitation of the family;

在道德、音乐和政府方面，已确立者的保守主义和未确立者的实验主义;


the conservatism of the established, and the experimentalism of the unplaced, in morals, music, and government;

政治的腐败和行为的扭曲;


the corruptions of politics and the perversions of conduct;

宗教与科学的冲突，道德的超自然支撑的削弱;


the conflict of religion and science, and the weakening of the supernatural supports of morality;

阶级、国家和大陆之间的战争;


the war of the classes, the nations, and the continents;

穷人反对经济上强大的富人，富人反对政治上强大的穷人;


the revolutions of the poor against the economically powerful rich, and of the rich against the politically powerful poor;

民主和独裁之间的斗争，个人主义和共产主义之间的斗争，东方和西方之间的斗争，所有这些都鼓动着古代希腊辉煌而动荡的生活，仿佛是为了我们的指导。

the struggle between democracy and dictatorship, between individualism and communism, between the East and the West-all these agitated, as if for our instruction, the brilliant and turbulent life of ancient Hellas.

在希腊文明中，没有任何东西，不能照亮我们自己。

There is nothing in Greek civilization that, does not **illuminate** our own.

------
我们将通过文化元素的相互作用，以及希腊兴衰的五幕大戏来了解希腊的生活。


We shall try to see the life of Greece both in the mutual interplay of its cultural elements, and in the immense five-act drama of its rise and fall.

我们将从克里特岛和它最近复兴的文明开始，因为显然从克里特岛和亚洲来了迈锡尼和提林的史前文化，它慢慢地将移民的阿该亚人和入侵的多里安人转变为文明的希腊人;


We shall begin with Crete and its lately resurrected civilization, because apparently from Crete, as well as from Asia, came that prehistoric culture of Mycenae and Tiryns which slowly transformed the immigrating Achaeans and the invading Dorians into civilized Greeks;

我们将花一点时间来研究勇士和情人，海盗和行吟诗人的男子气概的世界，这是随着荷马诗句奔流的河流而来到我们身边的。


and we shall study for a moment the virile world of warriors and lovers, pirates and troubadours, that has come down to us on the rushing river of Homer's verse.

我们将看到利库尔古斯和梭伦领导下的斯巴达和雅典的崛起，并将追溯肥沃的希腊人在爱琴海的所有岛屿、西亚和黑海的海岸、非洲和意大利、西西里、法国和西班牙的殖民扩张。


We shall watch the rise of Sparta and Athens under Lycurgus and Solon, and shall trace the colonizing spread of the fertile Greeks through all the isles of the Aegean, the coasts of Western Asia and the Black Sea, of Africa and Italy, Sicily, France, and Spain.

我们将看到民主在马拉松中为自己的生命而战斗，在胜利的刺激下，在伯里克利的领导下组织起来，并在历史上最丰富的文化中开花结果;


We shall see democracy fighting for its life at Marathon, stimulated by its victory, organizing itself under Pericles, and flowering into the richest culture in history;

我们将愉快地欣赏人类的思想从迷信中解放出来，重新发明新的科学，使医学合理化，使历史世俗化，并在诗歌和戏剧、哲学、演讲学、历史和艺术方面达到前所未有的高峰;


we shall linger with pleasure over the spectacle of the human mind liberating itself from superstition, ereating new sciences, rationalizing medicine, secularizing history, and reaching unprecedented peaks in poetry and drama, philosophy, oratory, history, and art;

我们将忧郁地记录伯罗奔尼撒战争中黄金时代自杀式的结局。


and we shall record with melancholy the suicidal end of the Golden Age in the Peloponnesian War.

我们将考虑混乱的雅典为从失败的打击中恢复过来所作的英勇努力;


We shall contemplate the gallant effort of disordered Athens to recover from the blow of her defeat;

即使是她的衰落，也会因柏拉图和亚里士多德、阿佩莱斯和普拉克西特利斯、菲利普和德摩斯梯尼、提奥奇尼斯和亚历山大的天才而辉煌。


even her decline will be illustrious with the genius of Plato and Aristotle, Apelles and Praxiteles, Philip and Demosthenes, Diogenes and Alexander.

然后，在亚历山大将军的带领下，我们将看到希腊文明，它的强大超出了它的小半岛，突破了它狭窄的边界，再次泛滥到亚洲、非洲和意大利;


Then, in the wake of Alexander's generals, we shall see Greek civilization, too powerful for its little peninsula, bursting its narrow bounds, and overflowing again into Asia, Africa, and Italy;

向神秘的东方传授对身体和智力的崇拜，恢复埃及在托勒密亚历山德里亚的辉煌，用贸易和艺术丰富罗德岛;


teaching the cult of the body and the intellect to the mystical Orient, reviving the glories of Egypt in Ptolemaic Alexandria, and enriching Rhodes with trade and art;

与欧几里得在亚历山大和阿基米德在锡拉丘兹发展几何学;


developing geometry with Euclid at Alexandria and Archimedes at Syracuse;

芝诺和伊壁鸠鲁形成了历史上最持久的哲学;


formulating in Zeno and Epicurus the most lasting philosophies in history;

雕刻米洛的阿卜洛狄特，Laocoön，萨莫特布拉斯的胜利，帕迦摩的祭坛;


carving the Apbrodite of Melos, the Laocoön, the Victory of Samotbrace, and the Altar of Pergamum;

努力把政治组织成诚实、团结、和平的;


striving and failing to organize its politics into honesty, unity, and peace;

在内战和阶级战争的混乱中越陷越深;


sinking ever deeper into the chaos of civil and class war;

筋疲力尽的土地、腰和精神;


exhausted in soil and loins and spirit;

屈从于东方的专制、宁静和神秘主义;


surrendering to the autocracy, quietism, and mysticism of thed Orient;

最后几乎欢迎那些征服罗马人，垂死的希腊通过他们将她的科学、哲学、文学和艺术留给了欧洲，作为我们现代世界的生活文化基础。


and at last almost welcoming those conquering Romans through whom dying Greece would bequeath to Europe her sciences, her philosophies, her letters, and her arts as the living cultural basis of our modern world.

# CHAPTER I :Crete-克里特文明

一、地中海

## 1 I. THE MEDITERRANEAN 

 the mediterranean

当我们进入最美的水域，把大西洋和直布罗陀抛在身后时，我们立刻进入了希腊历史的舞台。

AS we enter the fairest of all waters, leaving behind us the Atlantic and Gibraltar, we pass at once into the arena of Greek history.

“就像青蛙围着池塘一样，”柏拉图说，“我们在这片海边定居下来。”

"Like frogs around a pond," said Plato, "we have settled down upon the shores of this sea."

甚至在这些遥远的沿海地区，希腊人早在公元前许多世纪就建立起了不稳定的、由野蛮人组成的殖民地:在西班牙的赫墨罗scopium和安普里亚斯，在法国的马赛和尼斯，以及意大利南部和西西里的几乎所有地方。

Even on these distant coasts the Greeks founded precarious, barbarian-bound colonies many centuries before Christ: at Hemeroscopium and Ampurias in Spain, at Marseilles and Nice in France, and almost everywhere in southern Italy and Sicily.

希腊殖民者在北非的昔兰尼和尼罗河三角洲的瑙克拉提斯建立了繁荣的城镇;

Greek colonists established prosperous towns at Cyrene in northern Africa, and at Naucratis in the delta of the Nile;

他们不安分的事业搅动了爱琴海的岛屿和小亚细亚的海岸，就像在我们的世纪一样;

their restless enterprise stirred the islands of the Aegean and the coasts of Asia Minor then as in our century;

他们在达达尼尔海峡、马尔莫拉海和黑海沿岸为他们的冒险贸易建造了城镇和城市。

all along the Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmora and the Black Sea they built towns and cities for their farventuring trade.

希腊大陆只是古希腊世界的一小部分。

Mainland Greece was but a small part of the ancient Greek world.

------
为什么第二组历史文明在地中海地区形成，第一组在埃及、美索不达米亚和印度的河流沿岸生长，第三组在大西洋繁荣，第四组可能出现在太平洋沿岸?


Why was it that the second group of historic civilizations took form on the Mediterranean, as the first had grown up along the rivers of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and India, as the third would flourish on the Atlantic, and asd the fourth may appear on the shores of the Pacific?

是因为地中海沿岸的气候更好吗?


Was it the better climate of the lands washed by the Mediterranean?

那时和现在一样，那里的冬雨滋润着大地，温和的霜冻刺激着人们;


There, then as now, winter rains nourished the earth, and moderate frosts stimulated men;

在那里，几乎一年四季，人们都可以在温暖但不会使人衰弱的阳光下过露天生活。


there, almost all the year round, one might live an open-air life under a warm but not enervating sun.

然而，地中海沿岸和岛屿的表面却没有哪个地方像恒河、印度河、底格里斯河、幼发拉底河或尼罗河的冲积山谷那样富饶;


And yet the surface of the Mediterranean coasts and islands is nowhere so rich as the alluvial valleys of the Ganges, the Indus, the Tigris, the Euphrates, or the Nile;

夏季的干旱可能开始得太早，也可能持续得太久;


the summer's drought may begin too soon or last too long;

在尘土飞扬的地壳下到处都是岩石。


and everywhere a rocky basis lurks under the thin crust of the dusty earth.

温带的北方和热带的南方都比这些历史悠久的土地更肥沃，在这些土地上，耐心的农民厌倦了驯服土地，越来越多地放弃耕作来种植橄榄和葡萄。


The temperate north and the tropic south are both more fertile than these historic lands where patient peasants, weary of coaxing the soil, more and more abandoned tillage to grow olives and the vine.

在任何时候，沿着一百个断层中的一个或另一个，地震都可能把人们脚下的地面劈开，把他们吓得断断续续地虔诚起来。


And at any moment, along one or another of a hundred faults, earthquakes might split the ground beneath men's feet, and frighten them into a fitful piety.

气候并没有把文明带到希腊;


Climate did not draw civilization to Greece;

也许它从未在任何地方创造过文明。

probably it has never made a civilization anywhere.

------
吸引人们进入爱琴海的是爱琴海的岛屿。


What drew men into the Aegean was its islands.

这些岛屿很美丽;


The islands were beautiful;

即使是忧心忡忡的水手，也一定会被那些从倒影的大海中耸立起来的像寺庙一样的山的变幻的色彩所感动。


even a worried mariner must have been moved by the changing colorsd of those shadowed hills that rose like temples out of the reflecting sea.

今天，地球上没有比这更可爱的景色了;


Today there are few sights lovelier on the globe;

在爱琴海航行时，人们开始明白为什么生活在这些海岸和岛屿上的人们对它们的爱几乎超过了对生命的爱，并且像苏格拉底一样，认为流放比死亡更痛苦。


and sailing the Aegean, one begins to understand why the men who peopled those coasts and isles came to love them almost more than life, and, like Socrates, thought exile bitterer than death.

但更进一步，水手很高兴地发现这些岛屿上的珠宝散落在四面八方，而且间隔如此之短，以至于他的船，无论是在东西之间还是在南北之间，距离陆地永远不会超过四十英里。


But further, the mariner was pleased to find that these island jewels were strewn in all directions, and at such short intervals that his ship, whether going between east and west or between north and south, would never be more than forty miles from land.

由于这些岛屿和大陆的山脉一样，都是连绵不断的领土的山顶，后来逐渐被难以捉摸的海水淹没了，因此，“一些令人欢迎的山峰总是映入眼帘，充当灯塔，为那些还没有罗盘指引方向的船只指路。


And since the islands, like the mainland ranges, were the mountaintops of a once continuous territory that had been gradually submerged by a pertinacious sea," some welcome peak always greeted the outlook's eye, and served as a beacon to ships that had as yet no compass to guide them.

再一次，风和水的运动共同帮助水手达到他的目标。


Again, the movements of wind and water conspired to help the sailor reach his goal.

一股强大的中央洋流从黑海流入爱琴海，逆流沿着海岸向北流动;


A strong central current flowed from the Black Sea into the Aegean, and countercurrents flowed northward along the coasts;

夏天的时候，东北风会定期吹来，帮助那些从欧辛海(Euxine Sea)去取谷物、鱼和毛皮的船只回到他们的南部港口。


while the northeasterly etesian winds blew regularly in the summer to help back to their southern ports the ships that had gone to fetch grain, fish, and furs from the Euxine Sea.

地中海很少有雾，持续不断的阳光使沿海的风变化多端，几乎在任何港口，从春天到秋天，一个人可能在早晨被带走，在晚上被带回来，布雷兹。


* Fog was rare in the Mediterranean, and the unfailing sunshine so varied the coastal winds that at almost any harbor, from spring to autumn, one might be carried out by a morning, and brought back by an evening, brecze.

------
在这些有利的水域中，贪得不厌的腓尼基人和两栖的希腊人发展了航海的艺术和科学。


In these propitious waters the acquisitive Phoenicians and the amphibious Greeks developed the art and science of navigation.

在这里，他们建造的船只大多比以往航行在地中海的船只更大、更快，也更容易驾驭。


Here they built ships for the most part larger or faster, and yet more easily handled, than any that had yet sailed the Mediterranean.

慢慢地，尽管有海盗和恼人的不确定因素，从欧洲和非洲进入亚洲的水路——通过塞浦路斯、西顿和提尔，或者通过爱琴海和黑海——变得比曾经为埃及和近东运送了大量商业往来的漫长而危险的陆路便宜了。


Slowly, despite pirates and harassing uncertainties, the water routes from Europe and Africa into Asia-through Cyprus, Sidon, and Tyre, or through the Aegean and the Black Sea-becamed cheaper than the long land routes, arduous and perilous, that had carried so much of the commerce of Egypt and the Near East.

贸易开辟了新的路线，增加了新的人口，创造了新的财富。


Trade took new lines, multiplied new populations, and created new wealth.

埃及，然后是美索不达米亚，然后是波斯;


Egypt, then Mesopotamia, then Persia withered;

腓尼基在非洲海岸、西西里和西班牙建立了一个城市帝国;


Phoenicia deposited an empire of cities along the African coast, in Sicily, and in Spain;

希腊就像一朵浇过水的玫瑰。


and Greece blossomed like a watered rose.

------
## 2 II. THE REDISCOVERY OF CRETE

克里特岛的重新发现

------
"有一个地方叫克里特岛，在深酒色的海中间，这是一个美丽富饶的地方，它是由水形成的;


"There is a land called Crete, in the midst of the wine-dark sea, a fair, richd land, begirt with water;

那里有许多数不清的人，有九十座城。”


and therein are many men past counting, and ninety cities."

当荷马在我们的时代之前的九世纪唱到这些诗句时，希腊几乎已经忘记了，尽管诗人没有忘记，这个在他看来即使在那时也是如此富有的岛屿曾经更加富有;


When Homer sang these lines, perhaps in the ninth century before our era,* Greece had almost forgotten, though the poet had not, that the island whose wealth seemed to him even then so great had once been wealthier still;

它拥有一支强大的舰队，控制着爱琴海的大部分地区和希腊本土的部分地区;


that it had held sway with a powerful fleet over most of the Aegean and part of mainland Greece;

在特洛伊城被围困的一千年前，它已经发展成为历史上最具艺术感的文明之一。


and that it had developed, a thousand years before the siege of Troy, one of the most artistic civilizations in history.

也许正是这种爱琴海文化——对他来说就像他对我们一样古老——荷马在谈到一个黄金时代时回忆道，那个时代的人们比他自己那个混乱的时代更加文明，生活更加高雅。


Probably it was this Aegean culture-as ancient to him as he is to usthat Homer recalled when he spoke of a Golden Age in which men had been more civilized, and life more refined, than in his own disordered time.

------
重新发现失落的文明是现代考古学的主要成就之一。


The rediscovery of that lost civilization is one of the major achievements of modern archeology.

这里有一个比基克拉底群岛上最大的岛屿大20倍的岛屿，气候宜人，其土地上的产品多种多样，曾经树木繁茂的山丘，地处腓尼基和意大利之间，埃及和希腊之间，是贸易或战争的战略要地。


Here was an island twenty times larger than the largest of the Cyclades, pleasant in climate, varied in the products of its fields and once richly wooded hills, and strategically placed, for trade or war, midway between Phoenicia and Italy, between Egypt and Greece.

亚里士多德曾指出，这种情况非常好，“它使米诺斯获得了爱琴海的帝国。”


Aristotle had pointed out how excellent this situation was, and how "it had enabled Minos to acquire the empire of the Aegean."

但米诺斯的故事，被所有古典作家奉为事实，却被现代学者斥为传说;


But the story of Minos, accepted as fact by all classical writers, was rejected as legend by modern scholars;

直到60年前，人们还习惯于认为，与格罗特一起，爱琴海的文明历史始于多里安人的入侵，或者始于奥林匹克运动会。


and until sixty years ago it was the custom to suppose, with Grote, that the history of civilization in the Aegean had begun with the Dorian invasion, or the Olympic games.

然后在公元1878年，一位克里特商人，恰如其分地名叫米诺斯·卡洛凯诺斯，在坎迪亚南部的一个山坡上发现了一些奇怪的文物。


Then in A.D. 1878 a Cretan merchant, appropriately named Minos Kalokairinos, unearthed some strange antiquities on a hillside south of Candia.

伟大的施利曼于1886年访问了这一遗址，他最近才复兴了迈锡尼和特洛伊城，并宣布他确信它覆盖了古代克诺索斯的遗迹，并与土地所有者展开谈判，以便立即开始挖掘。


t The great Schliemann, who had but lately resurrected Mycenae and Troy, visited the site in 1886, announced his conviction that it covered the remains of the ancient Cnossus, and opened negotiations with the owner of the land so that excavations might begin at once.

但是主人讨价还价，试图欺骗;


But the owner haggled and tried to cheat;

Schliemann在成为考古学家之前是一名商人，他愤怒地退出了，失去了在历史上增添另一种文明的黄金机会。


and Schliemann, who had been a merchant before becoming an archeologist, withdrew in anger, losing a golden chance to add another civilization to history.

几年后，他去世了。”


A few years later he died."

------
1893年，英国考古学家亚瑟·埃文斯博士(Dr. Arthur Evans)在雅典从希腊妇女手中购买了一些作为护身符佩戴的石灰石。


In 1893 a British archeologist, Dr. Arthur Evans, bought in Athens anumber of milkstones from Greek women who had worn them as amulets.

他对刻在上面的象形文字感到好奇，这些文字没有学者能读懂。


He was curious about the hieroglyphics engraved upon them, which no scholar could read.

他沿着石头找到了克里特岛，找到了通往那里的通道。


Tracing the stones to Crete, he secured passage thither.

在岛上四处游荡，收集他认为是古克里特岛文字的样本。


and wandered about the island picking up examples of what he believed to be ancient Cretan writing.

1895年，他购买了施利曼和雅典法国学校认定为克诺索斯的土地的一部分，1900年购买了其余部分;


In 1895 he purchased a part, and in 19oo the remainder, of the site that Schliemann and the French School at Athens had identified with Cnossus;

在那个春天的九个星期里，他和一百五十个人一起狂热地挖掘，挖掘出了现代历史研究中最丰富的宝藏——米诺斯宫。


and in nine weeks of that spring, digging feverishly with one hundred and fifty men, he exhumed the richest treasure of modern historical research-the palace of Minos.

从古代至今，我们所知的任何东西都无法与这个庞大而复杂的建筑相提并论，从外表上看，它与古希腊神话中著名的米诺斯、代达罗斯、忒修斯、阿里阿德涅和米诺陶洛斯的那座几乎无穷无尽的迷宫一模一样。


Nothing yet known from antiquity could equal the vastness of this complicated structure, to all appearances identical with the almost endless Labyrinth so famous in old Greek tales of Minos, Daedalus, Theseus, Ariadne, and the Minotaur.

在这些遗址和其他遗址中，似乎是为了证实埃文斯的直觉，人们发现了数千枚印章和泥板，上面的文字与埃文斯踏上这条路的那些文字类似。


In these and other ruins, as if to confirm Evans' intuition, thousands of seals and clay tablets were found, bearing characters like those that had set him upon the trail.

烧毁克诺索斯宫殿的大火保存了这些石碑，这些石碑上破译的象形文字和文字仍然隐藏着爱琴海的早期故事


The fires that had destroyed the palaces of Cnossus had preserved these tablets, whose undeciphered pictographs and scripts still conceal the early story of the Aegean.*

  

------
现在，许多国家的学生都赶赴克里特岛。


Students from many countries now hurried to Crete.

当埃文斯在克诺索斯工作时，一群意志坚定的意大利人——哈尔夫赫尔、佩尼尔、萨维诺尼、帕里贝尼——在圣三位一体(Hagia Triada, Holy Trinity)发现了一座石棺，上面画着克里特人生活中的明亮场景，并在费斯托斯发现了一座仅比克诺索斯国王的宫殿面积小的宫殿。


While Evans was working at Cnossus, a group of resolute Italians-Halbherr, Pernier, Savignoni, Paribeni-unearthed at Hagia Triada (Holy Trinity) a sarcophagus painted with illuminating scenes from Cretan life, and uncovered at Phaestus a palace only less extensive than that of the Cnossus kings.

与此同时，两个美国人，西格尔和霍斯太太，在瓦西利基、莫克洛斯和古尔尼亚有所发现;


Meanwhile two Americans, Seager and Mrs. Hawes, made discoveries at Vasiliki, Mochlos, and Gournia;

英国人——霍加斯、博桑凯、道金斯、迈尔斯——探索了帕莱卡斯特罗、赛克罗和扎克罗;


the British-Hogarth, Bosanquet, Dawkins, Myres-explored Palaikastro, Psychro, and Zakro;

克里特人自己也产生了兴趣，Xanthoudidis和Hatzidakis挖掘出了Arkalochori、Tylissus、Koumasa和Chamaizi的古代住宅、石窟和坟墓。


the Cretans themselves became interested, and Xanthoudidis and Hatzidakis dug up ancient residences, grottoes, and tombs at Arkalochori, Tylissus, Koumasa, and Chamaizi.

就在他们的政治家们准备战争的那一代，欧洲有一半的国家联合在科学的旗帜下。


Half the nations of Europe united under the flag of science in the very generation in which their statesmen were preparing for war.

------
这些材料是如何分类的呢?这些宫殿、绘画、雕像、印章、花瓶、金属、石碑和浮雕?


How was all this material to be classified-these palaces, paintings, statues, seals, vases, metals, tablets, and reliefs?

-他们被分配到过去的哪个时期?


-to what period of the past were they to be assigned?

随着研究的进行和知识的增加，埃文斯根据地层的深度、陶器样式的等级、以及克里特人在形式或动机上与在土地或沉积物中挖掘出的年代大致已知的类似物体的一致性，确定了这些遗迹的年代。


Precariously, but with increasing corroboration as research went on and knowledge grew, Evans dated the relics according to the depth of their strata, the gradation of styles in the pottery, and the agreement of Cretan finds, in form or motive, with like objects exhumed in lands or deposits whose chronology was approximately known.

他耐心地挖到克诺索斯下面，发现自己停了下来，在离地面43英尺的地方，在一块原始的岩石旁边。


Digging down patiently beneath Cnossus, he found himself stopped, some forty-three feet below the surface, by the virgin rock.

出土区域的下半部分被新石器时代的遗迹所占据，原始形式的手工陶器有简单的线性装饰，纺纱和编织用的纺锤轮，肥胖的臀部


The lower half of the excavated area was occupied by remains characteristic of the Neolithic Age-primitive forms of handmade pottery with simple linear ornament, spindle whorls for spinning and weaving, fat-buttocked

彩绘的滑石或粘土的女神，抛光的石头的工具和武器，但没有铜或青铜。


goddesses of painted steatite or clay, tools and weapons of polished stone, but nothing in copper or bronze.

*对陶器进行分类，并将其与古美索不达米亚和古埃及的遗迹联系起来，埃文斯将克里特岛的后新石器时代和史前文化分为三个时代——米诺斯早期、中期和晚期——每个时代又分为三个时期


* Classifying the pottery, and correlating the remains with those of ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, Evans divided the postneolithic and prehistoric culture of Crete into three ages-Early, Middle, and Late Minoan—and each of these into three periods.t

铜在地层中的首次或最低出现，用一种考古学的简写方式来说，代表着新石器时代一个新文明的缓慢崛起。


The first or lowest appearance of copper in the strata represents for us, through a kind of archeological shorthand, the slow rise of a new civilization out of the neolithic stage.

在早期米诺斯时代末期，克里特人学会了将铜和锡混合，青铜时代开始了。


By the end of the Early Minoan Age the Cretans learn to mix copper with tin, and the Bronze Age begins.

在米诺斯时代中期，最早的宫殿出现了:克诺索斯、费斯托斯和马莉娅的王子们为自己建造了豪华的住宅，其中有无数的房间、宽敞的仓库、专门的车间、祭坛和庙宇，以及令傲慢的西方人震惊的大排水管道。


In Middle Minoan I the earliest palaces occur: the princes of Cnossus, Phaestus, and Mallia build for themselves luxurious dwellings with countless rooms, spacious storehouses, specialized workshops, altars and temples, and great drainage conduits that startle the arrogant Occidental eye.

陶器呈现出五彩缤纷的光彩，墙壁上充满了迷人的壁画，一种线形文字的形式从先前时代的象形文字演变而来。


Pottery takes on a manycolored brilliance, walls are enlivened with charming frescoes, and a form of linear script evolves out of the hieroglyphics of the preceding age.

然后，在《米诺斯中篇II》的结尾，有一种奇怪的灾难把它那愤世嫉俗的记录写进了地层;


Then, at the close of Middle Minoan II, some strange catastrophe writes its cynical record into the strata;

克诺索斯的宫殿被夷为平地，好像是受到了大地的震动，或者是受到了费斯托斯的攻击，费斯托斯的宫殿暂时幸免于难。


the palace of Cnossus is laid low as if by a convulsion of the earth, or perhaps by an attack from Phaestus, whose palace for a time is spared.

但不久之后，费斯托斯、莫克洛斯、古尔尼亚、帕莱卡斯特罗和岛上的许多其他城市都遭到了类似的破坏;


But a little later a like destruction falls upon Phaestus, Mochlos, Gournia, Palaikastro, and many other cities in the island;

陶器上覆盖着灰烬，储藏室里的大罐子里装满了碎片。


the pottery is covered with ashes, the great jars in the storerooms are filled with debris.

中世纪的米诺斯三世是一个相对停滞的时期，在这期间，东南地中海的世界可能长期处于混乱状态，因为希克索斯征服了埃及。


Middle Minoan III is a period of comparative stagnation, in which, perhaps, the southeastern Mediterranean world is long disordered by the Hyksos conquest of Egypt.

 

------
在米诺斯时代晚期，一切又重新开始。


In the late Minoan Age everything begins again.

人类在每一次灾难下都保持耐心，重新燃起希望，鼓起勇气，重新建设。


Humanity, patient under every cataclysm, renews its hope, takes courage, and builds once more.

在克诺索斯、费斯托斯、泰利苏斯、圣特里亚达和古尔尼亚，新的和更精致的宫殿拔地而起。


New and finer palaces rise at Cnossus, Phaestus, Tylissus, Hagia Triada, and Gournia.

贵族式的扩张，五层楼高，这些贵族住宅的豪华装饰暗示着希腊人直到伯里克利才知道的财富。


The lordly spread, the five-storied height, the luxurious decoration of these princely residences suggest such wealth as Greece would not know till Pericles.

剧院竖立在宫殿的庭院里，男男女女与动物进行殊死搏斗的角斗场面逗乐了绅士和女士们，他们那张贵族的面孔安静地保持着警惕，至今还活着


Theaters are erected in the palace courts, and gladiatorial spectacles of men and women in deadly combat with animals amuse gentlemen and ladies whose aristocratic faces, quietly alert, still live_

 

------
在墙壁上的明亮壁画上。


for us on the bright frescoes of the resurrected walls.

欲望倍增，趣味高雅，文学繁盛;


Wants are multiplied,tastes are refined, literature flourishes;

成千上万的行业慷慨地允许穷人通过向富人提供舒适和美味来繁荣。


a thousand industries graciously permit the poor to prosper by supplying comforts and delicacies to the rich.

国王的大厅里满是喧闹的抄写员，他们正在清点分发或接收的货物;


The halls of the king are noisy with scribes taking inventories of goods distributed-or received;

艺术家们制作雕像、绘画、陶器或浮雕;


with artists making statuary, paintings, pottery, or reliefs;

高级官员举行会议，听取司法上诉，或分发盖着精美印章的文件;


with high officials conducting conferences, hearing judicial appeals, or dispatching papers stamped with their finely wrought seals;

当黄蜂腰的王子和镶满珠宝的公爵夫人们，吸引人décolleté，成群结队地参加由青铜和黄金闪闪发光的餐桌上的皇家盛宴。


while waspwaisted princes and jeweled duchesses, alluringly décolleté, crowd to a royal feast served on tables shining with bronze and gold.

在我们时代之前的16世纪和15世纪是爱琴海文明的鼎盛时期，是克里特岛的经典和黄金时代。


The sixteenth and fifteenth centuries before our era are the zenith of Aegean civilization, the classic and golden age of Crete.

## 3 III. THE RECONSTRUCTION OF A CIVILIZATIONIf

文明的重建




现在，我们试图从演奏居维叶的遗物中恢复这种被埋葬的文化，从克里特人零散的骨头中恢复——让我们记住，我们正在从事一种危险的历史电视，在这种电视中，想象力必须在静态的、零碎的材料的缝隙中提供活的连续性，人为地移动，但早已死去。


now we try to restore this buried culture from the relics that remainplaying Cuvier to the scattered bones of Crete—let us remember that we are engaging upon a hazardous kind of historical television, in which imagination must supply the living continuity in the gaps of static and fragmentary material artificially moving but long since dead.

克里特岛将一直默默无闻，直到它神秘的石碑找到他们的商博良。


Crete will remain inwardly unknown until its secretive tablets find their Champollion.

### 1.Men and Women


1.

我们看到克里特人在他们的艺术中自画像，奇怪的是，他们与在宗教象征中如此突出的双斧相似。


As we see them self-pictured in their art, the Cretans curiously resemble the double ax so prominent in their religious symbolism.

男性和女性的躯干都病理学上缩小到超现代的腰围。


Male and female alike have torsos narrowing pathologically to an ultramodern waist.

几乎所有的人都身材矮小，身材纤巧，动作优美，运动匀称。


Nearly all are short in stature, slight and supple of build, graceful in movement, athletically trim.

他们出生时皮肤是白的。


Their skin is white at birth.

追求暗色的女士们肤色白皙，通常都很苍白;


The ladies, who court the shade, have fair complexions conventionally pale;

但是，这些在阳光下追求财富的人皮肤黝黑，面色红润，因此希腊人(以及腓尼基人)称他们为“腓尼基人”——紫色的人，即“红皮肤”。


but the men, pursuing wealth under the sun, are so tanned and ruddy that the Greeks will call them (as well as the Phoenicians) Phoinikes-the Purple Ones, Redskins.

头部长而不宽，五官尖锐而精致，头发和眼睛明亮的深色，就像今天的意大利人;


The head is rather long than broad, the features are sharp and refined, the hair and eyes are brilliantly dark, as in the Italians of today;

这些克里特人显然是“地中海种族”的一个分支。


these Cretans are apparently a branch of the "Mediterranean race."

*男人和女人都把头发部分盘在头上或脖子上，部分盘在戒指上

The men as well as the women wear their hair partly in coils on the head or the neck, partly in ring
