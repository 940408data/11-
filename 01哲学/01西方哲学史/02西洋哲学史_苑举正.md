1 回答三个问题

- [ ] 我们的真善美的标准哪里来的
- [ ] 我们讲究的人权的价值来自哪儿来的【基督教的人权】
- [ ] 中国的道德环境是哪里来的

2 为什么希腊产生了西方哲学？

- [ ] 民主自由

- [ ] 世界是语言说出来的

  > 理论是不断辩论出来的

3 西方哲学的三条脉络

- [ ] 批判理性的传统
- [ ] 语言
- [ ] 理性的认识的缩小


# 自然哲学和智者学派

希腊哲学的三个特点

- [ ] 语言决定人类世界的存在
- [ ] 神话世界理性化的过程
- [ ] 独一无二中的文化传统产生了政治制度



本节课的三个重点

- [ ] 1 物理学的起源
- [ ] 2 用语言决定世界的存在会导致一个什么样的混乱的局面
- [ ] 3 苏格拉底的兴起是为了解决这个混乱的局面



先苏哲学的方法论

- [x] 1 批判理性主义

> 西方哲学的进展都是建立在批判的基础上进一步获得突破的可能）

- [x] 2 抽象思维的不断提高



## 自然哲学





## 智者学派

6大自然哲学的结果(自说自话)

在一个民主的社会中，谁有权利去说服别人，产生智者去教别人说法的技巧。重要的是***理性的论证和理性的说服只有一线之隔***。知道真理没有用，讲到所有人都哑口无言才叫厉害。在哪个说话能力重要的社会，每个人都是自己的律师，只有用说话保护自己，苏格拉底就是这样的人。Sophists是社会中最会赚钱的人。说话技巧在社会中非常重要。



1 先苏哲学（自然哲学）

2 智者和苏柏拉图亚里士多德

> 苏格拉底进行了西方哲学的第一次的革命【伦理学革命】
>
> 基督教哲学和儒家哲学很像，新教伦理与资本主义精神

## 苏格拉底

### 主张

•一、思考的對象，應為人性本質，而非自然本質。

> 苏格拉底进行了西方哲学的第一次的革命【伦理学革命】

•二、透過語言的對話，可以突顯人類獲得真理的限制。

> 通过对话，不断的去找哪些真的东西。助产术和辩证法

•三、張揚具有理想性格的知識份子。

•四、人人皆應作一個遵守國家法律的公民。



### 道德知识主义

•哲學家的思想重點，在於實現道德知識主義。

> I know what is true
>
> I know what is right to do 
>
> 一场思辨之旅
>
> 我们每个人都有道德直觉，但是并不能让我们决定所有事。 

•道德知識主義，就是「知行合一」。

•沒有人會作錯事，只有「無知」的人，會作錯事。

•「有知識的人」，就是會依照真理去做事的人。

因此，真知具有道德的強制性。



### 反诘法

学习西洋哲学一定要有对话的热情

•蘇格拉底哲學中最重要的部分（反詰法）：提問與回答。

•提問的目的是什麼？答案：進行對話交流。

•提問的意義是什麼？答案：進行捍衛對抗。

•提問的效用是什麼？答案：進行反諷啟發。

•提問的結果是什麼？答案：承認無知

•對話、捍衛與反諷之間的循環，構成學習的過程，其目的在於討論表面與真實之間的差別。

•哲學就是一個否定表面認知，探究真實本質的活動。







### 负责任的公民

蘇格拉底被柏拉圖塑造為一位忠於國家的人，因為他因捍衛國家法律的尊嚴，接受「蠱惑青年」的罪名，判處死刑。

在蘇格拉底的教育中，他鄙視感官上的滿足，卻因為提升美感而感到高興。

他將其一身的經歷，均奉獻給雅典公民，在市中心的廣場，不斷與來往的人進行對話，探討各種哲學理念。

蘇格拉底被公認為西洋哲學的奠基者，也是這種思想的實踐者。



> 苏格拉底的死亡，很重要？
>
> 对柏拉图留下一个很重要的问题，大家都说民主制度最理性，为什么最理性的制度会做出最不理性的判决？
>
> 柏拉图否定民主制，提出哲学家皇帝



### 总结

最重要的是反诘法

伦理学、知识论、修辞学、政治学（怎么成为一个公民）









# 智者学派和苏格拉底


```
The Sophists may be said to be the first Greek sceptics. The materialism of the Atomists, the idealism of the Eleatics, and the doctrine of universal change with which Heraclitus (Ephesians) was associated — all these tendencies resulted in a condition of unrest, out of which philosophy could not advance to a more satisfactory state until an enquiry was made into the problem of the value of knowledge. The Sophists did not undertake that enquiry, but they called attention to the existence of knowledge at all.
The Sophists【智者，诡辩学派】 may be said to be the first Greek sceptics【怀疑论者】. The materialism【唯物主义】 of the Atomists【原子论】, the idealism【唯心主义】 of the Eleatics【爱利亚学派】, and the doctrine【学说、教义】 of universal【common 普遍】 change with which Heraclitus【赫拉克利特】 (Ephesians) was associated — all these tendencies resulted in a condition of unrest【动荡】, out of which philosophy could not advance to a more satisfactory state until【直到】 an enquiry was made into the problem of the value of knowledge. The Sophists did not undertake【从事】 that enquiry, but they called attention to the existence of knowledge at all。
智者派可以说是最早的希腊怀疑论者。原子论者的唯物主义、埃利亚学派的唯心主义，以及与赫拉克利特（以弗所人）相关的普遍变化学说——所有这些倾向都导致了一种动荡的状态，哲学无法从这种状态中前进到更令人满意的状态，直到对知识的价值问题进行了调查。 智者并没有进行那种探究，但他们提请注意知识的存在。
```

## Sophistic


```
In brief, the Sophistic method was different from the Socratic method by being the method of strife (Eristic method) in contrast to the Socratic method of discovery (Heuristic method). Sophism is of great importance historically, because it was the evil influence of the Sophists that inspired Socrates with the idea of refuting them by showing the conditions of true knowledge.

In brief, the Sophistic method【智者的方法】 was different from the Socratic method【苏格拉底的方法】 by being the method of strife【斗争】 (Eristic method) in contrast to the Socratic method of discovery (Heuristic method). Sophism is of great importance historically, because it was the evil influence of the Sophists that inspired【启发】 Socrates with the idea of refuting【反驳】 them by showing the conditions of true knowledge.
简而言之，智者方法与苏格拉底方法的不同之处在于，它是斗争的方法（Eristic 方法），与苏格拉底的发现方法（启发式方法）相对。 Sophism 在历史上具有重要意义，因为正是 Sophists 的邪恶影响启发了苏格拉底，通过展示真知识的条件来反驳他们。
```

## Protagoras

```
Protagoras of Abdera (same as Democritus and learned philosophy from the Atomist),called the Individualist (for Plato, relativist) because he says rather famously: "Man is the measure of all things: of things which are, that they are, and of things which are not, that they are not”
Protagoras【普罗泰戈拉】 of Abdera (same as Democritus【德谟克利特】 and learned philosophy from the Atomist【原子论】),called the Individualist (for Plato, relativist) because he says rather famously: "Man is the measure of all things: of things which are, that they are, and of things which are not, that they are not”
阿布德拉的普罗泰戈拉（与德谟克利特相同，从原子论者那里学习哲学），
被称为个人主义者（对于柏拉图来说，是相对主义者），因为他说得相当有名：“人是万物的尺度：存在的事物存在的事物存在，不存在的事物存在的事物存在”
```

## Gorgias

```
Gorgias was called the Nihilist because of his doctrine:
Nothing exists; 
Even if something exists, nothing can be known about it; and 
Even if something can be known about it, knowledge about it can't be communicated to others. 
Even if it can be communicated, there is no incentive to do so.
高尔吉亚因其学说而被称为虚无主义者：
什么都不存在；
即使某物存在，也无从知晓； 和
即使可以知道关于它的某些东西，关于它的知识也不能传达给他人。
即使可以传达，也没有这样做的动机。 
```

## hippias

```
Hippias was called the Polymathist because he was a man of very extensive knowledge, and he occupied himself not only with rhetorical【修辞学】, philosophical【哲学】 and political【政治】 studies, but was also well versed【谙练、熟悉】 in poetry, music, mathematics, painting and sculpture【雕塑】, and he claimed some practical skill in the ordinary arts of life, for he used to boast of wearing on his body nothing that he had not made himself with his own hands. 
On the other hand, his knowledge always appears superficial as he does not enter into the details of any particular【特定的】 art or science, and is satisfied with certain generalities【概括性】, which enabled him to speak on everything without a thorough knowledge of any. 
希庇亚斯被称为博学者，因为他知识渊博，不仅精通修辞学、哲学和政治学，而且精通诗歌、音乐、数学、绘画和雕塑，他声称有一些实用的知识。 他精通日常的生活艺术，因为他曾经吹嘘自己身上所穿的任何东西都不是他亲手做的。
另一方面，他的知识总是显得肤浅，因为他不深入任何特定的艺术或科学的细节，而满足于某些概括性的东西，这使他能够在没有透彻了解任何事物的情况下谈论一切。
博学vs精通
```

## prodicus

```
Prodicus, called the Moralist because in his discourses, especially in that which he entitled "Hercules at the Cross-roads" (concerning the stake of selecting either virtue or vice), he strove【努力】 to inculcate【教授】 moral lessons, although he did not attempt to reduce conduct to principles, but taught rather by proverb, epigram, and illustration. He is the only sophist being somewhat praised by Socrates and Plato and the reason is clearly that his teaching contained moral lessons to take. But he still collect a handsome amount of money for offering lectures.

Prodicus，被称为道德家，因为在他的演讲中，尤其是在他题为“十字路口的大力神”（关于选择美德或恶习的利害关系）中，他努力灌输道德教训，尽管他没有试图减少 行为原则，而是通过谚语、警句和例证来教导。 他是唯一受到苏格拉底和柏拉图赞扬的诡辩家，原因很明显是因为他的教导包含了可以吸取的道德教训。 但他仍然收集了一大笔钱用于讲学。

很多东西区分不出来好的还是坏的。

## Gorgias by Plato

- [x] Gorgias: Rhetoric, Socrates, is my art.
- [ ]  高尔吉亚:苏格拉底，修辞学是我的艺术。
- [x] Socrates: Then I am to call you a rhetorician?
- [ ]  苏格拉底:那么我该称你为修辞学家?
- [x] Gorgias: Then pray do.
- [ ]  高尔吉亚:那就祈祷吧。
- [x] Socrates: And are we to say that you are able to make other men rhetoricians?
- [ ]  苏格拉底:我们能说你能让其他人成为修辞学家吗?
- [x] Gorgias: Yes, that is exactly what I profess to make them, not only at Athens, but in all places.
- [ ]  高尔吉亚:是的，这正是我所宣称的，不仅在雅典，而且在所有的地方。
- [x] Socrates: Then why, if you call rhetoric the art which treats of discourse, and all the other arts treat of discourse, do you not call them arts of rhetoric?
- [ ]  苏格拉底:那么，如果你把修辞学称为论述的艺术，而所有其他的艺术都是论述的艺术，你为什么不把它们称为修辞学呢?
- [x] Gorgias: Because, Socrates, the knowledge of the other arts has only to do with some sort of external action, as of the hand; 
- [ ]  高尔吉亚:因为，苏格拉底，其他艺术的知识只与某种外部行为有关，比如手; 
- [x] but there is no such action of the hand in rhetoric which works and takes effect only through the medium of discourse. 
- [ ]  但是在修辞学中却没有这样的手的作用，只有通过话语的媒介才能起作用。 
- [x] And therefore I am justified in saying that rhetoric treats of discourse.
- [ ]  因此，我有理由说修辞学处理的是话语。
- [x] Socrates: But there are other arts which work wholly through the medium of language, and require either no action or very little, as, for example, the arts of arithmetic, of calculation, of geometry, and of playing draughts.
- [ ]  苏格拉底:但是，还有一些艺术完全通过语言媒介发挥作用，不需要任何行动，或者只需要很少行动，例如，算术、计算、几何和下棋的艺术。
- [x] Gorgias: Exactly.
- [ ]  高尔吉斯:没错。
- [x] Gorgias: If you have the power of uttering this word, you will have the physician your slave, and the trainer your slave, and the money-maker of whom you talk will be found to gather treasures, not for himself, but for you who are able to speak and to persuade the multitude.
- [ ]  高尔吉亚:如果你有说出这句话的能力，你就会让医生成为你的奴隶，训练师成为你的奴隶，而你所说的那个赚钱的人也会为你聚集财富，不是为他自己，而是为你这个能说话并能说服众人的人。
- [x] Socrates: Now I think, Gorgias, that you have very accurately explained what you conceive【构思】 to be the art of rhetoric that rhetoric is the artificer of persuasion, having this and no other business, and that this is her crown and end.  
- [ ] 苏格拉底:我认为，高尔吉亚，你已经非常准确地解释了你所认为的修辞学艺术，修辞学是说服的工匠，只有这一点，没有其他的事情，这是她的冠冕和目的。 
- [x] Do you know any other effect of rhetoric over and above that of producing persuasion?
   除了产生说服力之外，你知道修辞还有什么其他作用吗?
- [x] Gorgias: No: the definition seems to me very fair, Socrates; 
- [ ]  高尔吉亚:不，这个定义在我看来很公平，苏格拉底。
- [x]  for persuasion is the chief end of rhetoric.
- [ ]  因为说服是修辞的主要目的。
- [x] Socrates: You, Gorgias, like myself, have had great experience of disputations, and you must have observed that disagreements are apt to arise; 
- [ ]  苏格拉底:你，高尔吉亚，和我一样，对辩论有着丰富的经验，你一定注意到分歧很容易产生;
- [x]  somebody says that another has not spoken truly or clearly;  
- [ ] 有人说另一个人说得不真实、不清楚; 
- [x] and then they get into a passion and begin to quarrel.  
- [ ] 然后他们就开始争吵起来。 
- [x] But I cannot help feeling that you are now saying what is not quite consistent or accordant with what you were saying at first about rhetoric.  
- [ ] 但我不禁觉得，你现在所说的与你最初所说的修辞不太一致或一致。 
- [x] And I am afraid to point this out to you that I speak, not for the sake of discovering the truth.
- [ ]  我害怕向你们指出，我说话，不是为了发现真理。
- [x] Now if you are one of my sort, I should like to cross-examine you, but if not I will let you alone.  
- [ ] 如果你是我的同类，我愿意盘问你，但如果不是，我就不打扰你了。
- [x]  And what is my sort?  
- [ ] 我是什么样的人?
- [x]  I am one of those who are very willing to be refuted if I say anything which is not true, and very willing to refute any one else who says what is not true, and quite as ready to be refuted as to refute. 
- [ ]  如果我说了什么不正确的话，我是那种非常愿意被反驳的人，我也非常愿意反驳任何说了不正确的话的人，我愿意被反驳，就像愿意反驳一样。
- [x]  For I imagine that there is no evil which a man can endure so great as an erroneous opinion about the matters of which we are speaking and if you claim to be one of my sort, let us have the discussion out, but if you would rather have done, no matter-let us make an end of it. 
- [ ] 因为在我看来，一个人所能忍受的最大的罪恶莫过于对我们正在谈论的问题持有错误的意见，如果你自称是我这一类人，那就让我们把这个问题讨论出来吧，但如果你宁愿这样做，那也无所谓——让我们就此结束吧。

你知道除了说服别人之外，修辞还有什么其他作用吗?
  Do you know any other effect of rhetoric over and above that of producing persuasion?

and then they get into a passion and begin to quarrel. 
但我不禁觉得你现在所说的与你最初所说的修辞不太一致或不一致。 
But I cannot help feeling that you are now saying what is not quite consistent or accordant with what you were saying at first about rhetoric. 
我恐怕要告诉你们，我说话不是为了发现真相。
And I am afraid to point this out to you that I speak, not for the sake of discovering the truth.
如果你和我一样，我愿意盘问你;如果不是，我就让你自己去。
Now if you are one of my sort, I should like to cross-examine you, but if not I will let you alone.
我是什么类型的?  And what is my sort?
我是那种非常愿意被反驳的人之一，如果我说了什么不真实的东西，我也非常愿意反驳任何其他说了不真实的东西的人，我既愿意被反驳，也愿意反驳。  
I am one of those who are very willing to be refuted if I say anything which is not true, and very willing to refute any one else who says what is not true, and quite as ready to be refuted as to refute. 
因为我想，对于我们正在谈论的事情，一个人所能忍受的最坏的事情莫过于错误的意见。如果你声称你是我这一类人，那就让我们把这个问题讨论出来，但如果你愿意这样做，那没关系，让我们把它结束。  
For I imagine that there is no evil which a man can endure so great as an erroneous opinion about the matters of which we are speaking and if you claim to be one of my sort, let us have the discussion out, but if you would rather have done, no matter-let us make an end of it.

## unexamin life

"An unexamined life is not worth living"




```
"An unexamined life is not worth living"
Someone will say: Yes, Socrates, but cannot you hold your tongue【舌头】, and then you may go into a foreign city, and no one will interfere【干涉】 with you? 
Now I have great difficulty in making you understand my answer to this. For if I tell you that this would be a disobedience【违反】 to a divine【神的】 command【命令】, and therefore that I cannot hold my tongue, you will not believe that I am serious; and if I say again that the greatest good of man is daily to converse【交谈】 about virtue【道德】, and all that concerning【关于】 which you hear me examining【审视】 myself and others, and that the life which is unexamined is not worth living - that you are still less likely to believe. And yet what I say is true, although a thing of which it is hard for me to persuade you.
有人会说：是的，苏格拉底，但你不能闭嘴，然后你可能会去一个外国城市，没有人会干涉你吗？
现在我很难让你理解我对此的回答。 因为如果我告诉你这是对神圣命令的违背，因此我不能闭嘴，你不会相信我是认真的； 如果我再说一遍，人最大的好处是每天谈论美德，以及所有你听到我审视自己和他人的事情，未经审视的生活不值得过——你更不可能相信。 然而我说的是真的，虽然我很难说服你。
```

- [x]  For if I tell you that this would be a disobedience to a divine command, and therefore that I cannot hold my tongue, you will not believe that I am serious;  
- [ ] 我若对你们说，这是违背神的命令，所以我不能闭口，你们就不信我是严肃的。

## the only thing

•“The only thing I know is that I do not know anything!”

•我唯一知道的東西就是我什麼也不知道！

------

At last I went to the **artisans**, for I was **conscious**【意识到】 that I knew nothing at all, as I may say, and I was sure that they knew many fine things; and in this I was not mistaken, for they did know many things of which I was ignorant【无知】, and in this they certainly were wiser than I was. But I observed that even the good artisans fell into the same error as the poets; because they were good workmen they thought that they also knew all sorts of **high matters**【问题，物】, and this defect【缺陷】 in them overshadowed【黑暗，遮蔽】 their wisdom - therefore I asked myself **on behalf of** 【代表】the oracle【神谕，甲骨文】, whether I would like to be as I was, neither having their knowledge nor their ignorance, or like them in both; and I made answer to myself and the oracle that I was better off as I was.

- [x] At last I went to the artisans【工匠】, for I was conscious【意识到】 that I knew nothing at all, as I may say, and I was sure that they knew many fine things;  
- [ ] 最后我去找那些工匠，因为我意识到我什么都不知道，我可以说，我相信他们知道许多好东西。 
- [x] and in this I was not mistaken, for they did know many things of which I was ignorant【无知】, and in this they certainly were wiser than I was.  
- [ ] 在这一点上我并没有错，因为他们确实知道许多我不知道的事情，在这一点上他们肯定比我聪明。 
- [x] But I observed that even the good artisans fell into the same error as the poets;  
- [ ] 但我注意到，即使是优秀的工匠也会像诗人一样犯同样的错误; 
- [x] because they were good workmen they thought that they also knew all sorts of high matters, and this defect in them overshadowed【遮蔽】 their wisdom - therefore I asked myself on behalf of the oracle, whether I would like to be as I was, neither having their knowledge nor their ignorance, or like them in both;  
- [x] 因为他们是优秀的工匠，所以他们认为自己也懂得各种深奥的事情，他们的这种缺陷掩盖了他们的智慧——因此我代表神谕问我自己，我是否愿意像我一样，既不具备他们的知识，也不具备他们的无知，还是两者都像他们一样; 
- [ ] and I made answer to myself and the oracle that I was better off as I was. 
- [x] 我对自己和神谕说，我这样过得更好。
